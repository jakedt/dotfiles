## install

* Clone this directory to ~/.dotfiles
* `zsh install.zsh` symlinks from ~/.file to ~/.dotfiles/file and clones dependencies.


## zsh

I use [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) as a zsh framework.
If you've never heard of it, it's like a nicer [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

## vim

I use [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) to install all my plugins for vim.
If you've never heard of it, it's like a nicer [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).
To install/update all the plugins run `vim +BundleInstall!`
